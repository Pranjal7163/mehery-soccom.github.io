# WABA prerequisites
Before a business can access the WhatsApp Business API, each client has to go through an approval procedure

To start using the WhatsApp Business API, you will need the following:
1. A Facebook Business ID (with a verified Business if possible)
2. A valid phone number with the ability to receive phone calls or SMS


### The approval procedure includes the following steps:

## Facebook Business ID
You need to have a Facebook Business ID before you can proceed to the WhatsApp approval process. To find your Business ID, log into the Facebook Business Manager of the business and navigate to Business Settings. The Business Manager ID is displayed under the business name. 

If you don’t have a verified Facebook Business account, you need to create a Facebook Business Manager. To create a Business Manager:
1. Go to [business.facebook.com/overview.](https://business.facebook.com/overview)
2. Click Create Account.
3. Enter a name for your business, your name and work email address and click Next.
4. Enter your business details and click Submit.

More information about the [creation of the Facebook Business Manager you can find here.](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1710077379203657)

## Message On Behalf request

After the Facebook Business Manager ID is provided, you will receive a Message on Behalf request. You need to accept it, so we can send messages on your behalf with your Facebook Business Manager ID.

To approve this request inside your FB Business Manager account, follow these steps:
1. Go to “Business Settings”
2. Click the option "Requests" and choose the section "Received".
3. Approve the request

## WhatsApp approval procedure / Verify your Business Client account
Start the process of verifying your business in Facebook Business Manager. This procedure helps to protect users from false information.
```alert
Attention: Once you’ve completed the official form with the legal business details, you won’t be able to change them.
```
Go to Security Center and click Start Verification. If you haven’t logged in to your Business account, the button will be grayed out.
- Enter your business details, click Next and select your business from the list.
- Select a phone number and confirm details.
- After you received the verification code, click the Submit button.

It can take some time for Facebook to check all the details and approve your Business Verification.

## Phone number, Display Name & Review Process
After the verification is successful, you will be able to add your phone number and the Display Name for your WhatsApp business profile.

During the WhatsApp approval procedure, the WhatsApp team reviews the client’s request according to the [WhatsApp Business Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-policy/). You can check the status in the Facebook Business Manager account.
